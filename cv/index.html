                <h3>Dad Joke Robot Reviewer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tasked with using 2 different RESTful JSON APIs and to have them communciate with one another to create an application with JavaFX</li>
                    <li>Wanted to create a wacky, whimsical project by grabbing a list of joke based on the user's search query</li>
                    <li>Have the user select their favorite dad joke and review their sentiment to the joke on a scale of 1 for Bad - 10 for Good</li>
                    <li>After giving their review, a robot will tell their review of the joke according to its calculation of what words were used to which the user can compare their response</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>TripAdvisor Mock App</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A Work-in-Development Project where me and my colleagues are planning to create an application similar to TripAdvisor</li>
                    <li>It would provide details about transportation, cuisines, restaurants, tourist hotspots, and weather forecast</li>
                    <li>Alongside with the behind-the-scene programming, this project is planned to have a user-focused interactive interface</li>
                    <li>Focusing on the implementation and creative thinking about the app makes it paramount to ensure user-satisfaction is the #1 priority</li>

                <h3>Big Data and Diagonal Sums</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using low-level system calls in C, I developed a program that can read a nXn matrix of whole number and locate diagonal sums of a specific value</li>
                    <li>It can read and write to files as input and output. It takes large datasets and compute the diagonal sums in an efficient and timely manner</li>
                    <li>The algorithm developed ensures that when a desired sum is exceeded or is met, it stops itself to prevent needless work.</li>
                    <li>It also uses threading processes to divide the work among many threads while simultaneously working on different parts of the code improving runtime and simplicity</li>
